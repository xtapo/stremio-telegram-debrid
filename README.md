Stream video, audio, and subtitle files directly from your private Telegram storage channels inside Stremio. This addon serves as a high-speed on-the-fly streaming HTTP proxy (fully supporting Range Requests for instant seek/scrubbing) that integrates your private Telegram channel into your personal Stremio library.

### Why I built this
I store my personal media files on a private Telegram channel. I wanted a way to play them directly on my TV through Stremio without paying for Debrid links or downloading the files first. Other tools I found required setting up complex external databases like MongoDB, so I wrote this lightweight, database-free Python script to serve as a fast streaming proxy with subtitle loading and instant skipping.

Contributions and bug reports are welcome! If you encounter issues, feel free to open a GitHub Issue, or submit a Pull Request with your improvements. All pull requests will be reviewed and merged accordingly.

## Key Features

- **Direct Catalog Browsing & Search**: Search files directly inside Stremio or browse the latest 50 files sent to your Telegram channel.
- **Metadata & Catalog Syncing**: Open entries in Stremio; the addon checks your Telegram channel for matching file names and links them as stream sources.
- **Stitched Split Streaming**: Automatically groups, merges, and streams multi-part file archives (such as `.001`, `.part1` patterns) as one continuous virtual stream.
- **Smart Segment Filtering**: Intelligently parses naming patterns and number sequences (e.g. Part 1, Part 2, V1, V2) from filenames to retrieve and stream only the exact segmented file requested.
- **Subtitle Auto-Mapping**: Automatically scans your channel for matching subtitle files (SRT, VTT, ASS), injects them, and auto-detects English, Spanish, and French tracks.
- **High-Speed Range Proxy**: Supports HTTP `206 Partial Content` streaming, enabling instant scrub/seek (fast-forwarding/rewinding) on players like ExoPlayer, VLC, and MPV.
- **Zero-Storage Footprint**: Streams files chunk-by-chunk in memory directly from Telegram DCs. No temporary server storage is consumed.
- **Secure Access Control**: Protects your endpoints using an optional API key query (`?api_key=...`) to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Custom Logging**: Log streaming activity directly back to a separate private Telegram channel.

## Stitched Split Streaming

If you have large media files (e.g., 4K HDR video backups) that exceed Telegram's file upload limits (2GB for bots, 4GB for user accounts), you can split them into smaller segments before uploading. The addon automatically detects, groups, and stitches them back together into a single virtual stream.

### Supported Split Formats
The addon parses standard split archive conventions including:
* **Numeric extensions**: `Video.mkv.001`, `Video.mkv.002`, `Video.mkv.003`...
* **Part indicators**: `Video.part1.rar`, `Video.part2.rar`, `Video.part3.rar`... (or `.part01.mkv`, `.part02.mkv`...)
* **Suffix delimiters**: `Video_part_1.mp4`, `Video_part_2.mp4`...

### How It Works Under the Hood
1. **Aggregation**: The catalog handler parses filename patterns and clusters split files together, presenting them as a single item with their total combined file size (e.g., `Stitch stream | 6.2 GB`).
2. **Dynamic Range Mapping**: When you press play or seek in Stremio, the addon maps the player's byte-range requests to the respective split files on the fly.
3. **In-Memory Sequential Access**: It downloads only the necessary segments from Telegram DCs and transitions between split messages seamlessly in memory, resulting in uninterrupted playback.

## Configuration Environment Variables

Configure these settings in your deployment dashboard or local `.env` file:

| Variable | Required | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `API_ID` | **Yes** | Your Telegram API ID from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org). |
| `API_HASH` | **Yes** | Your Telegram API Hash from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org). |
| `TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID` | **Yes** | Comma-separated list of private channel IDs (e.g. `-1001234567890`). |
| `BOT_TOKEN` | **Conditional** | Bot Token from `@BotFather` (required if `USER_SESSION_STRING` is not configured). |
| `USER_SESSION_STRING` | **Conditional** | Pyrogram Session String (highly recommended to bypass bot limits, see details below). |
| `API_KEY` | No | Add a secret key (e.g. `mykey123`) to secure your addon endpoint with `?api_key=mykey123`. |
| `ADDON_URL` | **Yes** | The public HTTP URL where your server is deployed (e.g. `https://myaddon.onrender.com`). |
| `LOG_CHANNEL_ID` | No | Telegram channel ID where play/stream logs are recorded. |
| `TIMEZONE` | No | Timezone for logs (e.g., `Asia/Kolkata`, `UTC+05:30`). Defaults to `UTC`. |
| `CACHE_TTL` | No | Cache duration in seconds for searches (default: `1800` [30 mins]). |

## Telegram Credentials: Bot vs. User Sessions

You can run this addon using either a standard Telegram Bot Token or a Pyrogram User Session String. Review the differences below:

### 1. Telegram Bot (Bot Token)
- **Drawback/Limit**: Telegram imposes a strict **2GB size limit** on all files uploaded/downloaded by bots. Any file in your channel larger than 2GB **will fail to stream**.
- **Setup**: Must make the bot an **Administrator** in your private channel so it has permissions to search channel history.

### 2. User Client (User Session String)
- **Benefit**: Bypasses the bot limit, allowing you to stream files up to **4GB** (the maximum file size for all standard Telegram accounts).
- **Setup**: Needs only standard member access to private channels.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Security Warning regarding `USER_SESSION_STRING`**
> A Pyrogram User Session String grants **complete access** to your Telegram account. Anyone who acquires this string can read, write, or delete messages in your personal chats and channels.
> - **Never** hardcode this string in files or push it to public repositories.
> - **Only** enter it as a secure secret environment variable on trusted hosting platforms (Render, Koyeb, Railway, etc.).
> - **Always** generate the session string on your trusted local computer.

### How to Generate a `USER_SESSION_STRING` Locally

Run the following command in your terminal to safely generate and export your session string:

```bash
python -c "
import asyncio
from pyrogram import Client
api_id = int(input('API ID: '))
api_hash = input('API HASH: ')
async def main():
    async with Client('temp_session', api_id, api_hash) as app:
        print('\nYour USER_SESSION_STRING is:\n')
        print(await app.export_session_string())
        print('\nCopy the string completely.')
async def run():
    try:
        await main()
    except Exception as e:
        import traceback
        traceback.print_exc()
asyncio.run(run())
"
```

## Deployment Platform Specs & Limitations

Read these limitations carefully to choose the hosting platform that best fits your requirements:

### 1. Hugging Face Spaces

Hugging Face Spaces is the recommended hosting platform as it provides fast networking, stable CPU environments, and does not require credit card verification.

* **Drawbacks & Security Warnings**:
  - **Generous Bandwidth**: Unlike Render's strict 5GB limit, Hugging Face does not enforce a rigid monthly bandwidth quota on free Spaces. This makes it the highly preferred platform for streaming video backups without hitting quota limits.
  - **Public Repos Only**: Free Spaces must be configured as **Public** to run. Private spaces require a paid subscription. Because your Space is public, **never upload your `.env` file to the files section**. Instead, add your configuration keys in your Space **Settings > Variables and Secrets** as secrets.
  - **⚠️ Illegal Activity Termination Policy**: Hugging Face strictly enforces its Acceptable Use Policy. Hosting copyrighted or unauthorized media files for public streaming will lead to **immediate Space deletion, permanent account termination, and potential legal notices/liability** from content owners. Only stream video files you legally own or have permission to access.
  - **Auto-Sleep**: Auto-sleeps after **48 hours** of inactivity. However, it wakes up within **10-15 seconds** of a new request, which is significantly faster than Render.

#### Hugging Face Spaces Setup Guide

1. **Create a Hugging Face Account**: Visit [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) and click **Sign Up** to create a free account.
2. **Create a New Space**: Click your profile picture in the top-right corner and select **New Space** (or go directly to [huggingface.co/new-space](https://huggingface.co/new-space)).
   - **Space Name**: Choose a name (e.g. `my-stremio-addon`).
   - **License**: Choose `mit` or leave blank.
   - **Select the Space SDK**: Click **Docker**.
   - **Docker Template**: Select **Blank** (do not select template options like Gradio or Streamlit).
   - **Space Visibility**: Set to **Public** (required for the free tier; private spaces require a paid subscription).
   - Click **Create Space**.
3. **Configure Environment Secrets**: Click the **Settings** tab in the top menu of your newly created Space. Scroll down to the **Variables and secrets** section and click **New secret** to add each of the following variables:
   - `API_ID`
   - `API_HASH`
   - `BOT_TOKEN` (or `USER_SESSION_STRING`)
   - `TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID`
   - `API_KEY` (highly recommended to secure your public Space endpoint!)
   - `ADDON_URL`: Set this to `https://<your-username>-<your-space-name>.hf.space` (you can find this URL by clicking "Embed this Space" in the top-right menu of your Space page).
4. **Push the Files**: Clone your Hugging Face Space repository locally (git commands are shown on the Space's homepage). Copy all files from this project (except `.env` and `.git` folders) into your cloned Space folder. Commit and push the changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: deploy addon"
   git push
   ```
   Hugging Face will automatically detect the `Dockerfile`, build the container, and deploy your addon. Once the status turns to **Running**, your addon is live!

### 2. Render
- **Cost**: Hobby/Free Tier. No credit card required at signup.
- **Drawbacks**: 
  - **⚠️ Bandwidth Limit (Strict 5GB/Month Outbound Limit)**: Render imposes a strict **5 GB limit** of free outbound bandwidth per month for web service apps (unlike static sites which get 100GB). Since video streaming is data-intensive, **you will hit this 5GB limit almost immediately**. If you exceed it without a credit card/billing configured, **Render will temporarily deactivate your service addon** (it will not ban your personal Render billing account, but the streaming proxy will stop working until the next billing cycle starts or you upgrade).
  - **Auto-Sleep**: The container spins down/goes to sleep after **15 minutes of inactivity**. If you haven't used Stremio for a while, opening a video will trigger a wakeup request. The container will take **1 to 2 minutes** to build/spin up, causing Stremio to show a connection error initially. Simply wait 60 seconds and try playing again.

### 3. Koyeb
- **Cost**: Free Tier. **Requires card verification at signup** (even though you won't be charged).
- **Drawbacks**:
  - The container stays continuously active (no auto-sleep), but you must verify your identity with a valid credit card during registration.
  - Limited to 1 free service per organization.

### 4. Railway
- **Cost**: Trial Tier. Provides $5 free credits (approx. 500 hours of continuous runtime per month).
- **Drawbacks**:
  - The service will run out of hours and stop working before the end of the month unless you upgrade to a developer account (which requires a card and charges on usage).

### 5. Zeabur
- **Cost**: Trial Tier. Limited credits.
- **Drawbacks**:
  - Similar to Railway, has a limited free trial tier or resource caps.
